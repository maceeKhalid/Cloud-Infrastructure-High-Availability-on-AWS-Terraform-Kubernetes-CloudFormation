# üå©Ô∏è Cloud Infrastructure & High Availability

This repository is a **flagship collection** of projects focused on deploying **scalable and highly available infrastructure on AWS** using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with CloudFormation and Terraform, plus Kubernetes for container orchestration.  

These projects demonstrate **real-world cloud design patterns**: auto-scaling, load balancing, container orchestration, and high availability.
